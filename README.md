# GD-High-Priority-Launcher
Python program made to open the game Geometry Dash with high priority for better performance.

## How does it work?
This quick program was made to automatically open Geometry Dash via Steam for you, detect the process, and set It's priority to HIGH, nothing complicated.

## It doesn't work!
Sometimes you might encounter an error while trying to locate the process or setting the priority, when that happens please try to open the program again as Administrator.

# REQUIREMENTS:
### Python (version 3 or higher | Added to PATH recommended.)
## Open CMD and type in:
## `pip install psutil`

# You're finished!
You can now open the `main.py` or the `GDLauncher.exe` file to launch the program! (If you've installed all of the requirements)
